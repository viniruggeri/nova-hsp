# Ant Colony World Configuration
# Agent-based model of ant colony with resource dynamics

# Colony structure
n_cells: 100         # Number of cells/locations
n_ants: 200          # Number of ants in the colony

# Graph structure
graph:
  type: grid         # Options: grid, random
  grid_size: 10      # For grid: creates 10x10 grid
  k_neighbors: 4     # For random: degree of connectivity

# Resource parameters
initial_resource: 100.0      # Starting resource level per cell
consumption_rate: 2.0        # Resource consumed per ant per timestep
replenish_rate: 1.5          # Resource added per cell per timestep

# Ant behavior
movement_prob: 0.3           # Probability ant moves to neighbor cell

# Collapse conditions
collapse:
  resource_threshold: 50.0   # Collapse if total resources <= this
  starving_frac: 0.6         # Collapse if starving fraction >= this

# Simulation parameters
max_steps: 200       # Maximum timesteps before stopping

# Seeds for reproducibility
seed: 0
