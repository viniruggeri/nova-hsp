# Metric: Lead Time to Basin Collapse
# How far in advance does S_t < δ before actual bifurcation?

metric: lead_time

params:
  # Detection thresholds to sweep
  thresholds: [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7]
  persistence: 3             # K consecutive steps below δ

  # Normalization
  normalize: true            # LT_norm = (t_bif - t_alert) / (t_bif - t_start)

# Expected ranges:
#   Saddle-Node:  LT_norm > 0.15 at δ=0.5
#   Ecosystem:    LT_norm > 0.20 at δ=0.5
#   DW:           LT_norm ~ 0.0 (sudden, no early warning)
expected:
  min_lead_time_norm: 0.10
  good_lead_time_norm: 0.20
