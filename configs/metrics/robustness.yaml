# Metric: Robustness / Sensitivity Analysis
# How stable is S_t under perturbation scale σ and MC samples N?

metric: robustness

# MC convergence test
mc_convergence:
  n_values: [50, 100, 300, 500, 1000]
  n_trials: 5               # Repeat each N this many times
  # Expected: std(S_t) ∝ 1/√N (CLT behavior)

# Perturbation scale sensitivity
perturbation_sensitivity:
  std_values: [0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20]
  n_rollouts: 500            # Fixed N for fair comparison
  # Expected: S_t decreases monotonically with σ (A2 → larger ε = harder to survive)

# Horizon sensitivity
horizon_sensitivity:
  horizons: [20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 150]
  n_rollouts: 300
  # Expected: S_t decreases with H (longer rollout = more time to diverge)

# Separability: AUC for pre- vs post-collapse classification
separability:
  width_threshold: 0.10     # W > threshold → "basin exists"
  expected_auc: 0.85         # Minimum expected AUC
