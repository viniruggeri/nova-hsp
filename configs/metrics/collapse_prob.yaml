# Metric: Basin Contraction Correlation
# ρ(S_t, W_t) — Spearman correlation between S_t and basin width
# Primary validation metric for S_t as geometric estimator

metric: basin_contraction_correlation

params:
  min_width: 0.05           # Exclude post-collapse region where W < min_width

# Expected ranges (from NB 09-10):
#   Saddle-Node:   ρ > 0.95
#   Ecosystem:     ρ > 0.90
#   Disease-Free:  ρ > 0.85 (threshold system, weaker coupling)
expected:
  pass_threshold: 0.80
  strong_threshold: 0.90

# Also report monotonicity fraction
monotonicity:
  enabled: true
  # Expected (from NB 11):
  #   SN: ~80% (N=300), improves with N
  #   ECO: ~84%
  #   DW: ~54% (A3 violated)
